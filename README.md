# Sentence-Generator
Grammatically correct English language sentence generator that randomly creates sentences using parts of speech analysis. Java program. The program has preset sentence structures and combines them together in different ways with conjunctions and then adds subordinate clauses. Then the program adds words to the base structure, and then displays the sentence on the screen. 

After sentences are generated a GUI appears in which the user can hover over words to test themselves on their parts of speech and functions in a sentence.

I worked on this project for my final project at leap@cmu 2015 in advanced programming.
